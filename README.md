# MongoDb
This directory consists of MongoDB projects that I am working on as part of  Eduonix "Projects in MongoDB - Learn MongoDB Building Projects" online Course.
Project 1- In this we built a RESTful API and used Mongo.js, Node.js and Express.js for managing and accessing the ProductCatalog Database created in MongoDB. Then we used the RESTClient Firefox extension for constructing custom HTTP request ( to directly test requests against the db server.
